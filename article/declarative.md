# A New Combination of Old Techniques
The microcontoller and 'makers' have had such a successful run, with breakout boards that keep beginners from making bad mistatkes to code libraies that tame complex hardware into accessable, effective electronics. Eight bit processors have been all but replaced with 32 bit, multi core systems at the same price and size. A few meta-makers of these breakout boards are keeping up with the times in setting up easy to use libraries in accessable languages.

Adafruit hardware and their well supported Circuitpython software have mapped out a path for maker success. Smoothing out the leaning curve keeps makers successful and teaches annalog and digital electronics allong the way.

All this capability is the new magic carpet.

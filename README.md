# blinky-state
The "hello world" of microcontroller: blinking an LED is done with circuitpython's asyncio and a statemachine in the XState format.

# A simple start to a new combination of old techniques
This repo is such a simple application and at first glance seems over complicated, but now is a time when proven (old) techniques can be combined to provide a declaritive, event driven approach to microcontroller programming. The impulse to stop instucting beginner programmers in instructing a computer with exactly commands is a procedural approach. While programming in this way is simple to teach, it leaves students off in a blind alley of bad programming practices. Procedural programming will never scale a program into a full application and neither will it scale a student into programmer. A (first article)[https://nmorse.github.io/blinky-state/article/declarative.mdx] in a series, starts here with a simple first microcontroller application that starts off on the correct foot.
